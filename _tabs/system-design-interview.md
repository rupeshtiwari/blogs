## Why System Design Matters

System design interviews are the **#1 differentiator** for senior engineering roles. Companies test:

- **Scalability thinking** - Can you build systems that handle millions of users?
- **Trade-off analysis** - Do you understand when to choose what?
- **Technical depth** - Do you know distributed systems fundamentals?
- **Communication** - Can you explain complex ideas clearly?
